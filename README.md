# Google-Meet-Auto-SignIn

This project is based on Selenium framework. With this project, I have automated my Google Meet Sign In process. For this project, we require a webdriver for our chrome browser. We also need to install selenium python package for our module.

The chrome browser web driver can be downloaded from the following link:
https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

For installing selenium package, in your command prompt give the following command:
pip install selenium
